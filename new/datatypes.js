let name="neeraj"//string datatype
let islogedin=false //boolean
let age=18 //number datatype
//number -2 to power 53
//bigint
//string -""
//for string
console.log("neeraj")// we can use single court and doible court both 
console.log("neeraj's  ojha ")// but for like this we can use double court as single court is used if we use single court it will show error and will identify as neeraj's is ending there not will consider ojha
//null--stand alone value
//undefined
//symbol--unique
console.log(typeof age)//number
console.log(typeof undefined)//undefined
console.log(typeof null)// object , dont be confused now learn after now
