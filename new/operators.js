//operators in javascript
/* 1. arithmetic operators 
(*, +, -, **,/,%,++,--)*/
/* 2. Assignment operators 
(=,+=,**=,-=)*/
/*3. comparison operators 
(==,>,<,<=,>=,!=,===,!==) this last two are different let check it baaki is same as other language
*/
console.log(5==5)// here 5=5 is true;
console.log(5=='5')/* here in this operator ==double in js its different this double one just doesnt check data type so just will throw true becuase in js 
its doesnt compare data types it only comapres number*/
console.log(5==='5')/* here this triple operator === in js it compares first data type if its not than throw false */
console.log(5!=5)/* here this will throw false because its equal to 5 */
console.log(5!='5')/* here it will throw also false but in this 5 is in string but it doesnt compare datattypes so will throw false*/
console.log(5!=='5')// here it will compare data types and will throw true it compares datat types
